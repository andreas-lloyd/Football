What we have so far:
- Articles properly downloaded etc.
- Some really basic NER that just uses capital letters

What we want to do (long term):
- Be able to query articles in some structured way
- In this way, reccommend and build analytics around these articles

What we want to do (short term):
- Tag articles in some structured way so that we can create a database
    - What the article is about - general category
    - Who are the principal entities

What we need:
- Have the entities - but don't know what sort they are (is this important?)
    - We could do some sort of look up online, which I guess works for football because they are important / popular / written about
        - Maybe we could just search it on wikipedia and get the most important thing that comes up
        - Or on DBpedia
        - I guess not really interested in who it is, just what sort of thing it is (lends itself more to graph)
    - If we had another problem then we could use graph theory and find certain relationships and realise who is who
    - Another issue is that we would like to unify things - which might translate better to look ups? or graph theory and then reduce when things are very similar
    - For graph, could insert people into that community 


Maybe the best approach would be to download some dataset with teams and player names + managers and then match against that? This would at least be OK for marking what sort of entity it is
- I think marking the entity type and unifying are the next steps
- Because once that is done, creating relations is the next step
- Maybe first would be to mark off and then NEXT we could unify




Plan:
- Should have separate data pipelines - one for the raw data extraction (the basic scraping) and one for the treatment of this 
- This would be sort of like a layer 1 / layer 2 type set up
- Then the treatment for the layer 1 > 2 is what we are doing now, where we want to extract the entities and treat them in some way
- Maybe the actual treatment of the entities should be part of a process of 2 > 3

Need something that converts some of the entities to a more normalised form
- Can easily do some of this with a file - for easy nickname conversion
- Some other nicknames are a bit harder to do - e.g. United - but maybe we could have a process that compares those links to existing candidates

To do:
- Finish the wikipedia look up and json saving
- And then process the entities using this loop
- Then build a more proper pipeline where we can save the entities and their types etc.
- And then start thinking about pushing stuff to a datebase
