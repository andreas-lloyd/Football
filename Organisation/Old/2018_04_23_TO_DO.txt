TO DO:
- Finish lookback on work computer data
- Maybe make a clean up script (this could be put off for now and instead save some of the HTML to zips and save on external hard drive)

- START DATA ANALYSIS - script to pull all stories and save to CSV or something

- Should work with a basic model, like spacy's entity recognition, and get the top terms - then can do a backwards search
