- Log handling
    ADD: Some more INFO level output to keep track of some processes
    REASON: I think level is good but unclear from some logs what has been done

- Path handling
    REPLACE: Manual handling
    REASON: Easier / more robust
    IDEAS FOR PACKAGES: ... have to search a bit, shouldn't be hard

- Only passing directories
    REPLACE: Loading in full HTML
    REASON: Will speed up if we only pass in directories, not full HTML texts

- Optimising storage
    LONG TERM: Do things in a chain and save as little as possible (i.e. pull HTML, analyse, etc.)
    SHORT TERM: Could delete large parts of the HTML that are unused to maybe save aout 50% memory, at least - potentially cause fewer problems down the line too - REMOVE ALL HEAD??
