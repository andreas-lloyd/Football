Development:
    Was a good idea to separate "working" data and "development" data, as in production and developemtn type environments. That way
    could easily test stuff quickly on reduced sets of data where understood what was going on.

    Have to think about what information is being saved and in which order we are doing things - maybe it isnt useful or good to save all info,
    and instead do the progress in a chain, deleting as we go along (keep things in memory but temporarily)

    Probably would have been a bit smarter to build the full process once - with one source (more or less) and then add more later, just to be a bit more agile and 
    flexible - because when got to really "detail specific", ended up losing focus and forgetting stuff because of volume of specific stuff

Scripts:
    Logging is pretty useful - where can keep "small" messages in DEBUG and then progress info at INFO levels - this way 
    don't clutter the feed and slow everything down.
