Connected Components:

- We could say that each entity is a node
- Then we could say that the edge is being in the same article, and the strength is simply the count
- In this way we could find clusters and assign those clusters IDs
- We could also detect new connections and use those as alerts for potential developments

Page rank:

- See where the most important connections for clusters are and use as feature?
- Could also use it to define what sort of relation exists

Centrality:

- Recommendations could start on path going down to different clusters - then we typically start asking about things WITHIN that cluster, but otherwise we could also suggest some general articles from others
    - Sort of like > more general popular, generic articles if cluster is not main cluster, and if main, then more specific
- This is essentially a sort of community detection


Edge types can be article types
