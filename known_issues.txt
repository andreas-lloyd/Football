ISSUE 1:
    Example:
        Found the link
        http://www.bbc.comhttp://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42695334

        vs.

        http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42463444

    Problem:
        We have tagged on bbc.com when it was not needed

    Solution:
        Well should also be eliminating the "." from the regex?

        Or change to [^\/]         \/([^\/][^www].*)

ISSUE 2:
    Example:
        Returned an HTML with forbidden that was part of suburls - on re-run it worked

    Problem:
        I think just getting rejected

    Solution:
        Need to add error handling somewhere to ignore the "forbidden"

ISSUE 3:
    Example:
        Look at log file from 26 at the end - codec error

    Problem:
        I think pulling something with bad encoding

    Solution:
        Need to investigate
