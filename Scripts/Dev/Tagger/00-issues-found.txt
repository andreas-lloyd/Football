Scraping issues:
- Fake link issue:
    - a set of the fake link articles are saving loads of "What the bookies say -", that don't have any additional info or anything
    - Need to check that everything is ok
    - Found several examples similar in fake link
- Boring links
    - Who was your man of the match?
- Team of the week
    - Could be interesting to include, but not really working well as of how it is now, probably because looking at transfer links
    

Processing issues:
- Multiple stories
    - Clearly have some things that contain multiple stories, certain types of links that summarise weekend news
    - Maybe have to keep a log of the types of articles that contain multiple - otherwise could maybe split into sentences?
    - Will have to be careful with these and not use in initial phase of reduced titles
    
Concepts:
- If a story is not really about a specific thing, is it interesting?

Correcting entities:
- Have to decide if player / manager / owner etc - probably better to just identify person and later correct
- Have to also think about how cities are handled (e.g. London's teams) > have to associate some how
- What about derbies? e.g. Old Firm derby - might be useful to identify too
- Something like VAR could be identified too - but maybe more to do with match events and could be a later stage thing
- Will try to observe if the capitals part is dealt with
- I think using look ups could be quite effective - as we could scrape from Wikipedia and use certain key things (e.g. Euro 2020)

Tagging:
- Have seen that there are some stories that take a specific format - could use that to identify teams / players
