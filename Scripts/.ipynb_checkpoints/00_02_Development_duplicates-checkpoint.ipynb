This is the first step because an identical URL can return different results depending on the date (e.g. football/teampages/Arsenal) - but if the HTML is the same, then all of the stories on that page are the same (as, by definition, the suburl is where we look for headlines). Once this is done, none of the contained headlines will be searched, saving a lot.\n",

There could be a slight aspect where stories could actually be updated at a later date - will ignore this case for now.
