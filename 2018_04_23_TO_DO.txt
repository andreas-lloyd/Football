TO DO:
- GENERAL: Get the os.path.join involved instead of strings / or transfer to using Pathlib in general
- Finish lookback on work computer data
- Finish development / testing / execution of duplicate deleter
- Maybe make a clean up script (this could be put off for now and instead save some of the HTML to zips and save on external hard drive)

- START DATA ANALYSIS - script to pull all stories and save to CSV or something
